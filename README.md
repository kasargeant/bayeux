# BAYEUX

A simple, capable and pragmatic Tap-based test framework.

## FEATURE

* No *magic* globals like: 'describe' and 'it'. 
* Works IN your test code... not as a runner outside it!
* Super f'cking simple, super f'cking solid and super f*cking fast!
* ...how much more do you people want!!!

Anyway, just an idea I'm playing with at the moment.  If it comes to anything... I'll be sure to let you know!!! ;)
